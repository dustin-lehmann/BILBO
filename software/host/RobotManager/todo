- frodo agent class -> fetch data
- have a centralized getData for all robots, store the data in the agent class


Marker Handling:
- add translation from marker to frodo agent in the data acquisition function
- optional: filter out strays by mocap data

- add uncertainty to measurements on FRODO -> easy fix for today: make it circular, just depending on distance
- uncertainty:
- add uncertainty circle to map

- in the map: delete the measured point if it is no longer in the data


Logging:
- enable logging to file when executing experiment
